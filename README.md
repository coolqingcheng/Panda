### 3.1 front desk

Main project directory `"/panda"`, using `ASP.NET Core MVC 7.0` development, including the website foreground. Please configure the project before running correctly. Please see the following instructions.

1. Configure database connection string

In the project `Panda`, add nodes to the `appsettings.json` file and configure MySQL connection strings. It is recommended to use `appsettings.Development.json` and `appsettings.Production.json` configuration:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "MYSQL_DB": "server=localhost;user=[username];database=[databasename];port=[port];password=[password];SslMode=None"
}
```

2. Data migration

Open the package console and select the project: `panda Entity`, execute the following command:

```shell
Update-Database
```

If you delete `Panda.Entity/Migrations` directory, just execute the following command

```shell
Add-Migration InitDB
Update-Database
```
3. Generate data seed

After the above 2 steps are completed, run the project and visit the link `http://localhost:5151/initaccount` execute seed data generation. This method is written in the controller `AccountController` of project `Panda.Admin`：

```C#
[AllowAnonymous]
[HttpGet("/initaccount")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Test()
{
    await _accountService.InitAccount();
    return Content("初始化账号成功");
}
```

The default account is as follows, which is used by background management:

```shell
account: admin
password: admin
```

4. Release

```shell
dotnet publish
```
